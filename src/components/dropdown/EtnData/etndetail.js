   rev:"“Avatar” (2009) ended with the colonizing forces – humans represented by RDA military troops, being defeated by the combined might of Na’vi clans and the wildlife of Pandora. RDA security chief colonel Miles Quaritch got taken down by Neytiri and Jake, and except for a few loyalists, the rest of the humans were banished from Pandora. Jake Sully became the Olo’eyktan, the leader of the Omaticaya clan, renounced his human body, and transferred his consciousness into his Avatar body permanently. “The Way of Water” opens with a beautiful montage of Pandora’s wilderness and Jake Sully’s voiceover notifying us that fifteen years have passed since the events of the great war. Jake and Neytiri have found their bliss in raising a family of their own, which includes their sons Neteyam and Lo’ak and daughters Kiri and Tuktirey. Kiri is their adopted daughter, and she was born from the comatose Avatar body of Dr. Grace Augustine. The kids are accompanied by another adopted brother, Miles Socorro, aka Spider, who is the son of the late colonel Quaritch. Spider wasn’t sent home because cryosleep for children wasn’t possible, and he grew up in Pandora with the Sully kids. Although Jake has accepted him as their adopted son, Neytiri finds it hard to trust him due to his parental background. However, Spider feels more at ease with the Na’vi lifestyle and is inflicted with guilt over his father’s actions. Kiri and Mike are close as adopted siblings.Their idyllic family life is shaken to the core as humans return to Pandora to seek retribution. To the couples’ absolute shock and horror, they see a fleet of human spaceships landing on the Pandoran wilderness and purging vast areas of forest along with its portion of megafauna in the process. Once again, humankind builds its stronghold on the purged land and resumes Pandora’s colonization. A year has passed since then, and we are re-introduced to Quaritch, now in his new “recombinant” form. It turns out that Quaritch and some of his followers were reanimated after death. Their consciousness was transferred to a cloned Avatar body, and as a result, in their new form, they have all the memories of their past life up to their death. Quaritch is briefed about the present situation of the re-takeover of Pandora and the fact that Jake is leading guerrilla attack squads to squander human efforts. Quaritch swears vengeance as he decides to kill Jake and prepares to lead his troop in an attack on the Omaticaya clan.",

    title: "The Kashmir Files",

    date:"Jan 26 2022",
   cast:"Mithun ChakrabortyAnupam KherDarshan Kumaar.The story revolves around Krishna Pandit (Darshan Kumar), a JNU student, who thinks his parents were killed in an accident as told by his grandfather, Pushkar Nath (Anupam Kher). But the truth is more depressing. He is caught in the middle of two opposing narratives of the Kashmiri Pandit exodus of 1990. One side is represented by the pro-Azaadi JNU professor (Pallavi Joshi) who is gaining a lot of support on the campus for her Kashmir cause. On the other side is Nath, who has been struggling for 30 years to get justice for the exodus, which the professor claims is a sham. After Pushkar Naths death, Krishna goes back to Kashmir to fulfil his last wishes and also meets four of Naths friends, a journalist, a doctor, a former police officer, and a retired civil servant. They are shocked to know that Krishna didnt know the true story of his fathers death. The Kashmir Files then becomes a journey of discovering the truth for Krishna. In one among many traumatic scenes, Krishnas father, hiding in a container of rice, is killed by a local militant. His mother is forced to eat the blood-soaked rice from the same container.",
   rev:"Rendered refugees in their own country, based on testimonials of the survivors, the film makes a strong argument that this wasn’t just an exodus, but a barbaric genocide that continues to be brushed under the carpet for political reasons. Living in exile for almost 30 years, their homes and shops encroached by the locals, the Kashmiri Pandits (KP) continue to hope for justice and most importantly, to be acknowledged. It’s strange that not many films have broached this incident despite its gruelling impact on displaced families.Be it any ideology, faith or suffering, voices being curtailed seems to be a common nightmare. Kashmir, a lost paradise has been grappling with humanitarian crisis, cross border terrorism, separatist movements and fight for self-determination. Once prosperous and multi-cultured, now a disputed territory that struggles to stabilise itself amidst the constant tension, its wounds run deep and The Kashmir Files rips off the band-aid. In a span of little less than 3 hours, we try to get to the truth. But as they say, every truth has two sides.",

   cast:"NTR, Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, Samuthirakani, Alison Doody, Ray Stevenson.Set in the 1920s and spoken in the Telugu language, the film follows the unlikely friendship of Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.), two Indian freedom fighters who come together to revolt against the British Raj.  ",
   rev:"With a budget of ₹550 crore (US$69 million), Rajamouli’s film, RRR, released in March 2022, is India’s most expensive film to date. It is also India’s fourth top box office earner ever. RRR’s overwhelming popularity had fans feeling it was a sure bet for India’s Best International Feature Film candidate at the 2023 Academy Awards, but it was snubbed for a lesser-known film, Chhello Show. “Almost everyone knew that if RRR was sent as the Indian selection for the Oscars, we had a very, very big chance at making it through, but it didn’t happen,” Rajamouli concedes in an interview with Den of Geek magazine.RRR is a historical fantasy based loosely on two real-life Indian rebels, Alluri Sitarama Raju (1897–1924, played by Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (1900–1940, played by N.T. Rama Rao Jr., a.k.a. NTR). Although these folk heroes never met, RRR imagines that they united to fight against British colonialism in the 1920s. RRR stands for Roudram Ranam Rudhiram in Telugu, which means “Rage War Blood” but has been translated to English as the alliteration-preserving “Rise Roar Revolt.” It is also a play on the three popular filmmakers (R)ajamouli, (R)am Charan, and Rama (R)ao Jr.The enormous scope of Rajamouli’s action appears in one of the earliest scenes of RRR. To establish Raju’s (a.k.a. Ram—note that this is an abbreviation of Raju’s middle name Sitarama, as well as the name of the actor portraying him) hardcore character, he is introduced at the Anangpur Police Outpost as it is being besieged by a massive mob of enraged protestors (and massive is an understatement here). When a thrown rock shatters a photo of King George V, the commanding officer orders that the perpetrator be arrested. Ram storms into the crowd alone, battling hundreds of rioters with only his lathi baton. It’s a staggeringly violent action sequence, the magnitude of which dwarfs all previous cinematic one-versus-many fight scenes. Ram beats his way through the horde with terrifying resolve and superhuman strength.“It is a kind of dream for every human being to do things that are beyond the scope of a human being,” Rajamouli explains. “But I feel at the same time giving a superpower also takes away the vulnerability of the character.” Rajamouli says his characters remain human and vulnerable, so when Ram battles through the violent mob, “He can lose at any time.

   rev:"KGF:Chapter 1' set the tone for a slick gangster franchise-high on style and details. The first part was all about establishing the intentions and power of Raja Krishnappa Bairya aka Rocky Bhai. The second part has managed to create hype with its promotional content that gives a peek into the film. Does the film manage to match the build-up? It does and provides a better sequel and also has a big surprise for fans in the end, too.The film begins with Vijayendra Ingalagi, the son of Anand Ingalagi, taking over as the narrator. Rocky has won over the people of KGF and he is now in the process of dreaming bigger and treading more dangerous paths. In this process, he encounters Adheera, who is inspired by the Vikings and evokes visceral fear, who wants KGF back. Simultaneously, he also has to encounter the righteous Prime Minister Ramika Sen, who also wants Rocky taken downThe story progresses at a brisk pace in a racy tale of Rocky's journey to the top. The film, like the first part, presents a dark, dreary world that is stylishly shot. While the first part took time to prove who the protagonist was and included more time to establish the same, this second part moves quicker and one gets to meet more characters. The conflicts and battles are more interesting this time. This film gets to showcase the emotional side of Rocky too, with a love story and even some glimpses into his past life that fuelled his ambition. The love story doesn't take away too much from the tale either. One of the best shots in the film is the introduction of Adheera played by Sanjay Dutt. It is pure magic on screen and evokes whistles organically. Raveena Tandon as the Prime Minister also has a good track. The other interesting addition is Rao Ramesh as the CBI officer. Prakash Raj also makes for a good narrator, with his baritone adding an immersive experience.The film belongs as much to filmmaker Prashanth Neel as it does to Yash. Both of them have managed to deliver a sequel that seems more immersive than the first part. Albeit, Prashanth has always maintained that the second part had the bigger chunk of his original story when they decided to break it into two parts.For the audience who wants to watch a loaded action film with style, heavy-duty stunts, and dialogues, this one is simply made to order. KGF: Chapter 2 might not appeal to the seemingly woke audience, who would question consent or nitpick on commercial staples like violence. But for those who love such films, here's an essential spoiler, as there is a hint at a possible third chapter in the end credits, so wait until the end.",

And it is good to see the third season is the best of the three.With a slightly shorter, tighter run of 8 episodes that supervises to tap every emotional aspect of childhood while launching more monsters from the Upside Down, the third season is a fun ride that never lets you down. With renovating assistance of humor, this time Stranger Things aims at what the web series does best.It is a clever return the Duffer Brothers (for creators), in spite of a creeping yet obvious strain on upping the terrors for the children of Hawkins.As with the earlier 2 seasons, a threat impends from the generic and murky science-lab realm. People in white coats have ill-recommended designs on Hawkins. In the meantime, those who recall the final shot of season 2 will know that the huge spider-akin Mind Flayer stays trapped but unharmed in the other world. While it bullies the poor residents of Hawkins yet one more time, Billy terrorizes while appearing cool (probably this is what he does best).",

Then he said, ” “Everything, as previously stated, takes its time. As in the village, everything will go at a sluggish pace. Everything is going to happen in its own time.”He attributed ‘Panchayat’s’ popularity to the show’s inherent simplicity. As a result, the show has been dubbed Panchayat, which reflects the show’s simplicity. He remarked that there are a lot of violent web shows available on OTT these days. Because of its simplicity, ‘Panchayat’ stands out in this context. Every character in ‘Panchayat’ is a mirror image of a real-life person. You are able to make a connection to these occurrences.He explained that the makers of the second season of Panchayat needed something at the end of the series that would keep the audience engaged.
