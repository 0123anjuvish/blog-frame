      cause:"Researchers do not yet understand all the factors that cause migraines. It appears they may be caused in part by changes in the level of a body chemical called serotonin. Serotonin plays many roles in the body and effects blood vessels. When serotonin levels are high, blood vessels constrict (shrink). When serotonin levels fall, the blood vessels dilate (swell). This swelling can cause pain or other problems. Another cause being studied is that migraine headaches go along with a spreading pattern of electrical activity in the brain. Some research suggests there could be a heredity factor for migraines, meaning they may run in families. Researchers have identified some genes associated with migraines. They are unsure why these genes impact some people more than others. The American Migraine Foundation reports that if one of your parents has migraines, there is a 50% chance that you will, too. If both of your parents have migraines, your chances jump up to 75%. Ultimately, migraines seem to be caused by a combination of factors: genetic, environmental, and lifestyle. Women are more likely to have chronic migraines (migraines that occur 15 days a month or more). This is likely linked to hormones. Hormones fluctuate each month around the time of your period. They can also fluctuate if you are pregnant or going through menopause.",

      treat:"Medicine to prevent migraines may be helpful if your headaches happen more than 2 times a month. You may want to consider this medicine if your headaches make it hard for you to work and function. These medicines are taken every day, whether you have a headache or not. Preventive medications for migraines can include prescription drugs often used to treat other ailments. Anti-seizure medicines, antidepressants, medicines to lower blood pressure, and even Botox injections are some of the preventive medications your doctor may prescribe. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors can also help prevent migraines. They do so by blocking a gene-related peptide in your sensory nerves. This peptide is known to increase during a migraine attack, so blocking it can help prevent migraines.There are also a number of non-medical treatments designed to help minimize migraine pain and frequency. One is an electrical stimulation device, which has been approved by the FDA. It is a headband that you wear once a day for 20 minutes to stimulate the nerve linked to migraines. Another non-medical treatment is counseling aimed at helping you feel in more control of your migraines. This counseling works best when paired with medical prevention of migraines as well. What else can I do to prevent migraines:- While there are no sure ways to keep from having migraine headaches, here are some things that may help:Eat regularly and do not skip meals.Keep a regular sleep schedule. regularly. Aerobic exercise can reduce tension and keep your weight in check. Obesity can contribute to migraines.Keep a migraine journal to track what triggers your migraines and what treatments are most helpful. Migraine treatment:There are 2 types of medicines for migraine treatments (abortive and preventive). One type, called “abortive,” focuses on stopping the headache from becoming severe and relieving the headache pain. You should start this type of treatment as soon as you think you’re getting a migraine. The other type, called “prophylactic or preventive” includes medicines that are taken every day to reduce how often headaches occur (outlined in the section above).Talk to your doctor about which of these two types of medicine is best for you. Some people use both types. Nonprescription and prescription medicines that are used often or in large doses may cause other problems.What medicines help relieve migraine pain :For mild to moderate migraines, over-the-counter medicines that may help relieve migraine pain include: Aspirin Acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol) An acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine combination (one brand name: Excedrin Migraine) Ibuprofen (one brand name: Motrin) Naproxen (brand name: Aleve) Ketoprofen (brand name: Orudis KT)People who have more severe migraines may need to try “abortive” prescription medicines. A medicine called ergotamine can be effective alone or combined with other medicines. Dihydroergotamine is related to ergotamine and can be helpful. Other prescription medicines for migraines include sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan, and frovatriptan.If the pain won’t go away, stronger pain medicine may be needed, such as a narcotic, or medicines that contain a barbiturate (sleep-inducing medicine). These medicines can be habit-forming and should be used cautiously. Your doctor may prescribe these only if they are needed and only for a short period of time.",

This is especially important if you are over 40 years, are overweight, have a chronic illness or haven't exercised in a long time. Pre-exercise screening is used to identify people with medical conditions that may put them at a higher risk of experiencing a health problem during physical activity. It is a filter or ‘safety net’ to help decide if the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you. Print a copy of the pre-exercise screening tool and discuss it with your doctor or exercise professional. Start with brisk walking. Aim for 30 minutes per session. Allow a minimum of 8 to 12 weeks to build up to regular running. Aim to increase your jogging time each session, and alternate between walking and jogging. Make sure you warm up and stretch thoroughly before you head out. Cool your body down with light stretches when you return. Make sure you have plenty of fluids and take a water bottle with you on your run. Try to drink plenty of water before, during and after any activity. Allow at least 2 complete rest days per week to avoid overtraining, which may cause injury. Consider other low impact activities, such as swimming, at least once each week.Plan your route. If possible, choose flat, grassy areas rather than hard or loose (such as sandy) surfaces to reduce the risk of injury. Avoid running near roads. This is especially important if you have a pre-existing condition such as asthma. Vehicle exhaust fumes can increase your risk of various cardiovascular and respiratory complaints or illnesses.Avoid the 'peak hour' periods to reduce your risk of inhaling air pollution from motor vehicles. If possible, schedule your runs for either the early morning or the evening. Wear clothing which wicks sweat away from the skin. Dress your upper body in layers of clothing so that you can take off layers as required. Apply SPF 50+ sunscreen to exposed skin areas. Buy an appropriate pair of shoes.",

What started out thousands of years ago in the East as a meditative practice has now evolved into a modern lifestyle craze that generates billions of dollars. This can be attributed to its adaptability—people from all walks of life can practice and receive the benefits of yoga. Many celebrities swear by this physical and spiritual practice, and even those who don’t practice yoga seem to know someone who does. Practitioners often describe their experiences using terms like peace, calm, balance, strength, flexibility, and relaxation. But what exactly is yoga? And how far has this practice strayed from its ancient roots?Yoga is a Sanskrit word translated as “yoke” or “union.” To yoke means to draw together, to bind together; or to unite. Its aim is to yoke or create a union of the body, mind, soul, and universal consciousness. This process of uniting the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of ourselves is what allows yogis to experience deep states of freedom, peace and self-realization.",

It helps us to become aware of our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs, and to change them when they no longer serve us. It gives us the tools to make better choices in life, and to live more fully.Yoga is a practice that allows us to transform and purify our bodies, minds, and souls.

We follow the traditional way of Hatha practices, breathing, concentration and meditation.During the hatha yoga classes the teacher will provide you as complete as possible information. Still it is needed for each one of us to always remain aware of some precautions in the practice of asanas. Hatha yoga is all about awareness of what happens in our body, breath and mind. This enables us to listen to our body and to respect its limits in a given moment of time, which may change from day to day. Yoga practice is not meant to be an aerobic exercise or about how far one can stretch or bend forward. As we study our inner Self, comparision with others is pointless. The main principle in hatha yoga is Ahimsa – non-violence to ourselves and to others. Learn to have faith in the wisdom of the signals of our body and breath. E.g.if the breath becomes irregular, we are probably putting too much effort in the practice. Go a little less far. God resides in the body so body is Divine and we have to treat the body with friendliness and respect. Be nice and gentle with yourself.In case of any serious health problems and in case of doubts regarding health issues, please before participating in the hatha yoga classes share your doubts with the teacher. In this way you enables us to properly give you guidelines to prevent further problems and to help you where possible with specific exercises to restore a healthy body and mind.
